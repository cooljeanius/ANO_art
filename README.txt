This repository is for artwork intended for use in the Wesnoth add-on
"A New Order", although not all of it will eventually ship with the final add-on.
Stuff that goes here:
- high-resolution originals
- material removed from previous versions
- unused material
- source projects for use with GIMP or Pixelmator or Photoshop or whatever
Compare this to how the main Wesnoth project has both a main repository and a
media respository:
Main Wesnoth repository: https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth
Wesnoth media repository: https://github.com/wesnoth/resources

Material here largely comes from this forum thread:

A_New_Order_units_and_pictures: images from the following thread:
                                https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?t=6174
akl_sprites: some basic Akladian sprites; might be duplicates, in which case they
             could be removed. Seems to be the current ones by sleepwalker.
ANO_nowe_story: "nowe" is Polish for "new"; images are used in story parts
ANO_sprites/images/akladian: old sprites, which are no longer used
ANO_UMC_art: misc. source images used to create other story images; some notes:
 - I'm assuming Khotyn Fortress is this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khotyn_Fortress
 - "krajobraz" is Polish for "landscape"
 - "skradacz" is Polish for "stealth"
 - I'm assuming Surami is this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surami
art: another copy of the old Akladian Clansman sprites, and a few story images
basicsr-sprites-rescaled: some of the sprites run through various upscalers
Discord: images from people on Discord
drummonds: a set of village graphics to be used as terrain on maps; I think
           "drummonds" was the artist
egallager: stuff by me (egallager); so far includes gif renderings of various
           animations, annotated images passed along as references to commissioned
           artists, and 1 frankenportrait of S01's medic
elven_trackers: some variants on a certain story image
FfuzzyLogik: images posted by user FfuzzyLogik in the main ANO forum thread
finished: more variants on certain story images, plus the logo
iborra: portraits of the main characters (Gawen, Karen, Lorin, Reme, & Ruvio) by
        Santiago Iborra
images/akladian: another copy of old sprites like those in ANO_sprites; probably
                 should decide which one of them to delete, since they're dups...
liscie: "liscie" is Polish for "leaves"; I'm not really sure where these are used?
modified_Wesnoth: some Aragwaithi sprites that are no longer used due to the 
                  Aragwaithi being replaced by Dunefolk, plus some characters used
                  in the background of some story images
moje: stuff by szopen (mostly different variants on weaker/generic Akladians)
sleepwalker: "sleepwalker" was the artist who made the current set of Akladian
             sprites; these appear to be dups of the ones in akl_sprites, in which
             case one of the two can be deleted...
sprites: another set of the old Akladian sprites that are no longer used and can
         probably be deleted; there are some interesting source materials in this
         directory, though
sprites_backup: good grief there are a lot of duplicates here
StableDiffusionGenerated: I keep meaning to do some experiments with AI in this
                          repo, which will eventually go here once generated
stare: old story images that are no longer used
sylar: a newer set of sprites for some of the more story-related characters
Thumbs_db: The original folder that szopen sent me included some Windows-created
           Thumbs.db files; the actual Thumbs.db aren't in the repo due to my
           .gitignore_global, but their contents are available in this folder.
           I extracted the images with Vinetto: https://github.com/AtesComp/Vinetto
twitter_comms: stuff that I (egallager) have been commissioning from random artists
               on Twitter
units: WML files for use by Wesnoth; no actual art here
upscaler: symlink to basicsr-sprites-rescaled
wesnothUMC: a few portraits that I don't think are actually used, plus some
            landscapes that look like they're copies of ones from mainline Wesnoth
wprawki: "wprawki" is Polish for "practice" or "exercises"; mostly a bunch of
         different versions or drafts of stuff used for various story images
Zareba: various portraits and story art by Łukasz Zaręba
