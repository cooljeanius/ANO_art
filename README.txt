This repository is for artwork intended for use in the Wesnoth add-on
"A New Order", although not all of it will eventually ship with the final add-on.
Stuff that goes here:
- high-resolution originals
- material removed from previous versions
- unused material
- source projects for use with GIMP or Pixelmator or Photoshop or whatever
Compare this to how the main Wesnoth project has both a main repository and a
media respository:
Main Wesnoth repository: https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth
Wesnoth media repository: https://github.com/wesnoth/resources

Material here largely comes from this forum thread:
