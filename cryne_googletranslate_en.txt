Over the years, it was less and less common for a newcomer among the Akladians
(someone who is not the son of the previous clan leader) to become the clan
leader. Cryne is one of the exceptions. He comes from a noble lineage, however,
by his birth, he would rather be one of the clan's warchiefs. He cut his way to
the top with bravery, swordsmanship, and ruthlessness.

Even from the time of his youth, Lorin was destined to be his wife - later,
however, the Gallorae clan decided to break the deal with Cryne by offering
Lorin to the then-king, Gawen Hagarthen's father. Cryne never gave up meet him
to care(?). He served the king indifferently, following his orders zealously and
without showing any hostility.

From the outset, Cryne was reluctant to the new habits that were starting to take
hold among the Akladians under the influence of their higher civilized subjects.
Cryne slept on skins thrown on the floor, not on a bed; he watched underling
swords and armor more willingly than the tricks of their jugglers and their
dancers.

He married late for the Akladians, at the age of 30 - and his wife was a
woman from the Akladian commune, distinguished by neither origin nor beauty.
He was looking forward to a descendant for a long time - like many other Akladian
women, it seemed that his wife had been placed under a mysterious curse of
infertility. Finally, his wife bore him a son, but she herself fell into a fever.
For once in life, Cryne sent for an underling medic, once he gave up his contempt
for their cultures - but in vain. His wife died. The medic, of course, soon
followed her. Cryne had his head chopped off, and sewed on a pig's head in its
place.

From then on, Cryne hated underlings, and all that underlings symbolized.
He hated those who were friends with underlings, those who took their women:
especially those who were born of these unions.

Cryne did not take another wife - also unusual among the Akladians. He did not
take part in feasts and hunts, avoided calls to the royal court. Instead, he
devoted himself to war, war, and war again. He fought with the rebels, while
committing acts so cruel that even Akladians (who, after all, had been polished
by three generations of life in Wesnoth) remembered them with horror. When the
rebels were lacking, he would go to the frontier to rob and burn underlings
living far from the king. It was then that he made contacts with bandits, often
using their services to get things done that would become a stain on his honor
if he had committed them personally.

At the time of ANO, Bor Cryne is around 40-45 years old. Light eyes (may be
yellowish, like those of Wesnoth orcs), perhaps they could be made very bright,
fiery. Remarkably masculine beauty. He is primarily a warrior who owes everything
to himself.
