Few of the Akladis are those with a fair complexion, and even fewer
there are those who would have fair hair. Blondes are hardly ever met
not at all - with the exception of the Gallorae clan. Where among the Gallorae such unusual features, no
you know. Rumors are that it was caused by the fact that it was during the invasion
all the men of this clan abandoned their wives and took instead
wedding notes. However, this may not be true, because apparently there are blondes among them
they had happened before during the escape from the garden beyond the deserts to the east.
Often, however, Gallorae's enemies were reproached for their appearance, suggesting them a mixed up
origin. The Gallorae themselves always tried to prove by deeds that they were suspicious
these are alien to them. Loyal to the king, courageous, happy in battle, they were strong
and a large clan. Despite themselves, however, they were often considered to be
one of the more important clans belonging to what would be called elsewhere
liberal party. Although reluctant to ties with pariahs, though
demonstratively religious and conservative, but because of the very appearance
were considered natural allies by all who
they wanted to end the eternal civil war against the pariahs.

Even pariahs considered Gallorae less savage and barbaric than others
Akladis. It is not known where this opinion came from, Gallorae themselves did not
nothing to give her a reason. It was enough, however, for a Gallorae to spare his life
some peasant who could not pay the tax so that the rumor about them would soon go out
nobility. It is true that the Gallorae were often gentle with their own people
subjects - it was not because of their love for them. Gallorae were treating
their subjects as their property and treated them as theirs
cattle, dogs or pigs. They made sure their dogs had warm kennels so that their cattle would not
they were starving, they were not killing their pigs unnecessarily - and exactly the same ratio
they had to "their" pariahs. They did not differ much from many others
Akladis. However, they were blond, so automatically many believed them to be
"his", to the endless annoyance of the Gallorae themselves.

Nevertheless, the Gallorae clan has always been considered of more importance,
than it would actually result from his wealth, strength, or actual influence.
