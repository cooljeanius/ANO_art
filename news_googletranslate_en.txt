Especially for members of the Polish Battle for Wesnoth community -
pre-release of the "A New Order" campaign. Campaign
she is now buried; admittedly it was already finished, but changes
in the Wesnoth engine meant that a lot of things had to be done from scratch.

The campaign was established
in 2005 for Wesnoth 0.9.3 and was probably the first
a campaign written by a Pole for this game. Later I had too little time
to take care of it and take care of it several times by volunteers.
Unfortunately, the Wesnoth engine has changed quite a bit since 2005; same
as well as the game itself. The current version of the campaign for version 1.8.0, although playable,
however, it has bugs and a lot of minor bugs.

Now, thanks to Spencer's involvement, Cooley's "The Sigil" is being created
campaign version. Mr. Cooley corrected my poor English, spent it
dozens of hours on scenario balancing. 90% of the work
related to the preparation of the new edition was done by him.
He had so much power in the campaign
work that I felt compelled to add something myself as well.
Remember that without Sigil's hard work, it would be impossible to re-release ANO. 
All hail Sigil! 

First, forgive a little bragging (well, maybe a little more than a little),
who had sneaked into this news. Remember that the only reward of the creators
the campaign is recognition from players; So be understanding as you see yourself
I am pleased with this recognition.

Today, six years later, some of the tricks I use in
The "New Order" may seem won over by other companies; But remember
that when I introduced them, they were something new. For example only, toggling
between the leaders, now easy thanks to the Wesnoth engine, required ode
me writing some rather complicated code.

"ESPECIALLY for when it was written, this code is outstanding. It would
literally take me months to do something like this, and I'm not certain I could
do it even half so well. A number of things this campaign does are 'firsts',
things that were later done by other code... It's a classic,"

"I played this campaign a long time ago (several years, I think...) and for me
it is one of the most underrated campaigns in Wesnoth. The storyline is very
interesting and there were many technical inovations that were later
incorporated in other campaigns "

In the past, several shortcomings of the "New Order" have been highlighted. No music
was one of them. With the approval of Nick Humphrey, Erik Rijshouwer and Christian
Hellerberg to use their music, no one - I hope - will be
complained about the silence in the headphones. Christian Hellerberg's piece stayed with this
written specifically for the new campaign release.

While the French, Spaniards or Poles were not bothered by mistakes in English,
native speakers of the language pointed out that:

"It is painfully obvious that English is not the original author's first
language, yet on the other side of that same token, the prose is so well
written that the one who wrote it put forth an effort, which was nothing short
of astounding. Perhaps it was a matter that the sheer effort put forth to write
it in coherent English, being put forth by an intelligent person, could not
have produced a work, which was not of high quality. "
only give a part to the first comma, but I couldn't help but
to quote the whole :-)).

Less importantly for Poles, English was corrected by Sigil. Suggested
he also made some plot tweaks. We are still discussing some of them :) From this
For this reason, there is no translation ready for pre-release yet.

What has been said about this campaign so far?

"Hi! I usually don't post much, but I just want to say that this is a marvelous campaign!!! I haven't enjoyed an add-on as much as this since IftU - story, dialogue etc."

"I just finished the campaign and it was with no doubt one of the most amazing campaigns i played. It felt like a "next-gen" Wesnoth at times, with the unmatched level of interaction with NPCs, large-scale maps, training levels, etc. So thanks a LOT for all the effort you must have put into this, it was really fun to play through."

"Hello, first post in the forums... :) I had to register just to say how great campaign this one is. :) .. I gave a try to ANO. I was pleasantly surprised of the quality of the storyline and of the new units/races."

"i think its one of the three best campaings i have ever play."

"I played it years ago, never was able to finish, and found it to be one of the most original and interesting campaigns in all of Wesnoth. I can't wait to try it again."

"I've played through it on easy level in the last few days and it was again a
stunning experience, the best campaign I've ever played on Wesnoth!
... The story is brilliant, it's something totally new, with new units I really
liked, the whole story is well-thought-out, I couldn't stop play because I
wanted the story to continue."

Amazingly few people have complained about the drawings, but we've improved that as well.
For this issue, we have specially commissioned works by professional graphic designers who
they created portraits and illustrations. We use the illustrations of Mr. Santiago Iborra
and Łukasz Zaręba - and a few additional compositions created by
Sigil and me. Although as a result we have fewer illustrations and portraits, but
quality hopefully makes up for the loss in quantity. Pre-release, old and new
the illustrations are still mixed up as not all graphics are ready.

Sigil wants the new ANO release to contain as few bugs as possible, and that it is
polished as best as possible. Hence the request for Polish players: help us catch up
errors and balance scenarios. Especially for you we are releasing the alpha version -
already playable, but in need of refinement. A few more drawings are missing in it
and music, but that shouldn't bother you. Please download the campaign
play, spot bugs, suggest corrections, send feedback on
campaign balancing etc. I hope the managers
wesnoth.com.pl will create a thread for the discussion of what
it should still be improved in the campaign. The Polish translation is not yet available
finished; I will go to it as soon as it finally stabilizes
English version.
