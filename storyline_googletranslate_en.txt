Storyline:
Background:
The Akladians are a nation of barbarians who have conquered a civilized kingdom
Wesnoth and its ruins founded their own states. They rule them
representatives of the Hagarthen family. Dark-skinned, savage barbarians despise
conquered Wesnotczyk, calling them "underlings". They also vary
from them by habits (not using magic, hating elves) and possession
a religion according to which the Akladians are the race chosen to rule the world.
Vesnotians have no religion.

The main character of the campaign is Gawen Hagarthen. He is the son of a king
Vakladia. His mother came from the royal family of Wesnotczyk and stayed
poisoned shortly after giving birth to her son. Gawen's father then married Lorin,
an Akladian girl from a family with great ambitions. The campaign begins
after the battle in which Gawen's father is killed and he is badly wounded (and wakes up
with amnesia). The first three scenarios are practice and introduction
player to the story. As a result, Gawen, with the help of faithful Reme and the caring,
young stepmother Lorin return to the capital, defeating the rebels.

In the capital, it turns out that the Akladians are rebelling against Gawen, some
for some of them consider him to be a hybrid unworthy of sitting on the throne. Gawen
he rushes at the head of his troops against the rebels. Most in battle
his own army is betraying him, among them the cruel Bor Cryne; Gawen commands
Remem to take Lorin, and he fights to the end, covering their retreat.

Reme abandons Lorin, claiming he has sworn allegiance to the Hagarthen and not hers;
He leaves her some gold and some soldiers. Lorin hires mercenaries and
acquires its own castle.

Meanwhile, Gawin survived the battle, he was brought out of the battlefield by Ruvio - Wesnotczyk,
leader of the rebels. It turns out that Ruvio was a trusted courtier
Gawen's mother; moreover, Gawen's mother and Ruvio were to be married before the father
Gawena decided that he had to join the Wesnok aristocracy. Ruvio
has a new family, several daughters, among them she is the eldest, floppy
Karen. Gawen at the head of the rebel army is quickly gaining recognition under
new name. He also discovers the rebel base, Freetown, where they live
free people.

Gawen soon meets Lorin, who is disgusted with not only hers
the foster son grows a beard, but also grows in the company
"subhumans". Following a deliberation in Freetown, Gawen learns that he is to Vakladia
armies of orcs are coming. Gawen makes a reconnaissance, as a result of which
learns of Bor Cryne's alliance with the orcs, and the arrival of a new one,
the mysterious "messiah", a Greek, who is supposed to allow the Akladians to conquer
rest of the world.

The rebels decide to seek out the oracle to ask for advice and to find it
the last mages in Wesnoth. Gawen's army manages to free the oracle from under
the siege of three armies. Lorin and the Oracle have a conversation that
it is completely incomprehensible to Gawen, and it has a devastating effect
on Lorin.
